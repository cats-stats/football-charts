## About 'Cats Stats
['Cats Stats](https://catsstats.timchartier.com/about-us/) was created at Davidson College in 2013 by four members of the Class of 2014 and mathematics professor Dr. Tim Chartier. They began offering advanced analytics to the Davidson College Menâ€™s Basketball team on a trial-basis, attempting to help the coaching staff and revealing insights through mathematical analysis. By the end of the first season and through much trial and error, the coaching staff realized that the work being done was not only helpful, but indispensable and asked the group to continue the following season. Since the members of the group were graduating, a new group of analysts were brought in and Cats Stats began to grow.
